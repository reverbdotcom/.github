# source: https://github.com/reverbdotcom/.github/blob/main/workflow-templates/conductor.yaml
#   Generates a workflow using conductor - triggers a deploy on demand.
#   This workflow will go away in the future, favoring orchestra sandbox. ( ask #dev-platform )
#
# ---
# How to use this template:
#
# 1. omit from 'options', branches that the repo does not support.
#
#     - lab
#     - infra
#     - preprod
#     - qa
#     - sandbox
# 2. ( optional ) if your chart name differs from your repo name, override with field `appName: <chart name>`.
# 3. remove this "how to" comment
# 4. commit as a PR
# 5. once merged to main, a new workflow will be generated for the repo.
